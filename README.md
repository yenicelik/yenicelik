### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, a software engineer with a strong background in machine learning and startups. I'm pretty active on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3262787/davetheal), having literally checked in every day for 5 years. Ping me if I can help with upvoting a question. 

I am deeply curious about new technologies, and how and where these can be used to drive impact. Some topics I've covered in the past:

- ðŸ“« **Machine Learning**: I started before TensorFlow was a thing, and back when people were using Torch, not PyTorch (It was running on Lua..). Almost became a contributor for TF, but becoming one is too tedious (lol, you guys should change sth if you read this). Even ended up writing my own neural-net framework using numpy (following Karpathy's CS231n guide back in 2016). I did a lot of research in my free time, but also with various departments at the ETH ZÃ¼rich Institute of Machine Learning, and published my work in an ACL EMNLP workshop. 
- ðŸŒ± **Software Engineering**: I wrote my first website when I was 13. It was supposed to be community-driven knowledge base tailored towards the International Baccalaureate. Back then writing HTML, CSS (and PHP, lol), was a thing. I ended up learning React, NextJS, Flask, Python, and some Rust for backend as well (you could say that I learned english that way as well). I like properly tested, readable, and well-maintainable code, writing proper CICD pipelines, and some Docker-pipelining.
- âš¡ **CTF**: Although I'm a complete n00b, I really enjoy Capture the Flag challenges. Delving into systems I don't understand well, and especially using probabilistic patterns to exploit is always interesting. I was shortly part of the ETH ZÃ¼rich FlagBot team in 2017. 

Oh, if you prefer all the business terminology and hyping all the achievements one has ever come close to, you might enjoy [my linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-yenicelik/) better. 

Please reach out to me on LinkedIn for any inquiries. I like to connect with like-minded, driven, and passionate people, and support you in any way I can.
